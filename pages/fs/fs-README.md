## License

Flutter Sound 9.x is released under the Mozilla very permissive Plublic License version 2.0 (MPL 2.0). This is a Free And Open Source license which has a **weak copyleft** clause: if you modify some of Flutter Sound code you must publish your modifications under the MPL license too. But you may publish your own App with any license you want. Even a Proprietary/Closed Sources License (shame on you!).

If you can and want to publish your App under the GPL 3.0 license, we suggest that you consider using the [τ-dio fork](https://tau.canardoux.xyz/td-README.html) which is in fact Flutter Sound 10.0 .

## We need help

We greatly appreciate any contributions to the project which can be as simple as providing feedback on the API or documentation.

Actually, my main project is the GPL [Taudio 10.0](https://tau.canardoux.xyz/td-README.html) and not anymore Flutter Sound. To be frank, I must say that there is no other main developers on Flutter Sound. This is bad, because Flutter Sound deserves to be maintained.
